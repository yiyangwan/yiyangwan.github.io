<!-- # About Me -->
* I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Intel Coperation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html). I hold a Ph.D. degree from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I was under the guidance of Professor [Neda Masoud](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/masoud-neda/). My dissertation committee included Professors [Mingyan Liu](https://liu.engin.umich.edu/), [Garbor Orosz](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~orosz/), and [Yafeng Yin](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/yin-yafeng/), and my area of specialization was [Next Generation Transportation Systems](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/research/infrastructure/transportation/). Prior to joining Intel, I was part of the [Next Generation Mobility Systems Lab](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nmasoud/index.html).
* I also hold a Master's Degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) from the University of Michigan, where I specialized in [Signal & Image Processing and Machine Learning](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/research/research-areas/signal-image-processing-and-machine-learning/). Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's Degree from the [College of Communication Engineering](https://dce.jlu.edu.cn/ENGLISH/HOM.htm) at [Jilin University](http://global.jlu.edu.cn/), where I achieved a cumulative GPA ranking in the top 1/91 and was awarded the National Scholarship.
* Throughout my Ph.D. studies, I have conducted research in two distinct areas. The first line of research focused on secure sensor state estimation and reinforcement learning, with applications in connected and automated vehicle technologies. Within this field, I explored topics including anomaly detection, adversarial bandits learning, and algorithmic game theory. The second line of research delved into combinatorial optimization, including peer-to-peer ride-matching and graph aggregation/disaggregation algorithms.
