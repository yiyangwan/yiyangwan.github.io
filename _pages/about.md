<!-- # About Me -->
**Updated Dec 2025**<br>
* I joined Amazon as a Senior Applied Scientist in Dec 2025. Prior to that, I spent three years as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Intel Corporation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html). At Intel, I worked on [causal discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_causal_analysis) and root cause analysis in semiconductor manufacturing. If you are interested in causal discovery and don't know where to start, I recommend [\<The Book of Why\>](https://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) by [Judea Pearl](https://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html), which explores causality and causal inference from statistical and philosophical perspectives for a general audience.
* I hold a Ph.D. from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), advised by Professor [Neda Masoud](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/masoud-neda/). My dissertation committee included Professors [Mingyan Liu](https://liu.engin.umich.edu/), [Gábor Orosz](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~orosz/), and [Yafeng Yin](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/yin-yafeng/). My specialization was [Next Generation Transportation Systems](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/research/infrastructure/transportation/). Prior to joining Intel, I was part of the [Next Generation Mobility Systems Lab](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nmasoud/index.html).
* I also hold a Master's degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) from the University of Michigan, specializing in [Signal & Image Processing and Machine Learning](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/research/research-areas/signal-image-processing-and-machine-learning/). Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree from the [College of Communication Engineering](https://dce.jlu.edu.cn/ENGLISH/HOM.htm) at [Jilin University](http://global.jlu.edu.cn/), ranking in the top 1/91 and receiving the National Scholarship.
* During my Ph.D., I researched two areas. The first focused on secure sensor state estimation and reinforcement learning for connected and automated vehicles, including anomaly detection, adversarial bandits, and algorithmic game theory. The second explored combinatorial optimization, including peer-to-peer ride-matching and graph aggregation/disaggregation algorithms.
